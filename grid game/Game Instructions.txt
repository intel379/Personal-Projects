Hi Grid Game is a personal project of mine, the aim is to control your player and defeat all enemies by collecting the sword before they kill you.

Setup
1. Open up the game by launching grid_game.py
2. select size of map by filling in rows and columns

How to play
1. Use 'wasd' to move your character 'P' around the map
2. Avoid enemies 'E' who will chase you
3. Grab the 'sword' and then chase enemies to kill them and win

Special Moves

Flash
Press F to drop a marker 'F' down. You can move afterwards and pressing F again teleports you to the Marker.
